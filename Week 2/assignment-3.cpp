Assignment 3: CIA Triad Case Study - M-Tiba Data Breach Analysis
Role: Cybersecurity Analyst
Incident: October 2025 - M-Tiba mobile health wallet platform breach

Incident Overview
In October 2025, a hacker using the alias “Kazu” claimed responsibility for a data breach on M-Tiba. Over 2.15TB of database data containing 17.1M files with personal and health records of 5M+ Kenyans was exposed and sold on the dark web. The breach remained undetected for 10 days before CarePay, the processor, became aware.

CIA Triad Analysis

C - Confidentiality: BREACHED
Confidentiality was violated when sensitive patient data including names, medical history, insurance details, and contact info was accessed and leaked publicly on Telegram channels.
Impact: Patients face risks of identity theft, medical fraud, blackmail, and stigma. This violates Kenya’s Data Protection Act 2019 which requires breach notification within 72 hours.
Analyst Note: Weak access controls and lack of real-time monitoring allowed unauthorized data extraction.

I - Integrity: POTENTIALLY BREACHED
With 10 days of undetected access, attackers could have altered medical records, insurance balances, or prescription data.
Impact: Tampered health data could lead to wrong diagnoses/treatments. Altered financial records cause loss to patients and insurers.
Analyst Note: Integrity controls like database hashing and audit logs should be implemented to detect unauthorized changes.

A - Availability: PARTIALLY IMPACTED
While M-Tiba services remained online, user trust and reputation dropped significantly. ODPC and partner insurers Jubilee/AAR learned of the breach through media, not internal alerts.
Impact: Reduced user confidence may lower adoption. Hospitals relying on M-Tiba for payments face operational risk.
Analyst Note: Availability wasn’t the main target, but Kenya saw 1,116% increase in ransomware attacks in 2025. Redundancy and backups are critical.

Root Cause - People & Systems Problem
This aligns with Week 2 mantra: “Security is not a technology problem. It’s a people-and-systems problem.”
People: Delayed detection + failure to notify users/regulators within 72hrs shows poor incident response training.
Systems: Lack of automated SIEM alerts, weak encryption, and missing patch management allowed the breach to persist.

Recommendations
Immediate: Isolate affected systems, enforce password resets + MFA, notify all 5M users per Data Protection Act.
Technical: Encrypt data at rest/in transit, deploy SIEM for real-time monitoring, conduct quarterly pen-tests.
People: Train staff on phishing/social engineering. CA flagged low user awareness as a main driver of cyber incidents. Create a documented incident response plan.

Conclusion
The M-Tiba breach primarily compromised Confidentiality, with potential impact on Integrity. As a Cybersecurity Analyst, the priority fix would be access control + monitoring, because attackers in Kenya increasingly exploit human error and slow system responses rather than just code vulnerabilities.
